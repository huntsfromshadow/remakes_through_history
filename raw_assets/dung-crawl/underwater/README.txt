This is a background and some tiles to simulate the experience of 
swimming under the water. I was wondering what to do if a player was 
allowed to walk on or into Clint Bellanger's water tiles and this is 
what I've come up with. To complete the experience there will need to 
be tiles to show where you can jump in, and tiles that show how to 
climb back out. Or perhaps you can just dive/surface at will.

- underwater: backdrop to draw under tiles
- submarine_floor: a modification of my dirt tiles tinted blue
- submarine_wall: a modification of the dungeon_wall tiles. I 
eliminated lowlights on the far tiles to make visibility seem very low.
