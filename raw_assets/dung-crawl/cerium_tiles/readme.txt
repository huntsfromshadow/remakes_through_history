ASCENSION: ADVENTURE TILES

This pack contains all the tiles in Ascension: Adventure. They are edits of Heroine Dusk's tileset (the game Ascension: Adventure is based on).

All tiles were created for 320x240. These are higher resolution than Heroine Dusks' tiles, unlike most of the other graphics. They cannot be scaled down without a loss of quality.

All tiles use the same 256-color palette, which is included in both Photoshop and GIMP formats. (cerium.act/cerium.gpl)

Some tiles may be oddly named. This is because I didn't change the names in the code.
